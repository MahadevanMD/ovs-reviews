</head><body>
<h1>OpenFlow 1.1+ support in Open vSwitch</h1>

<p>Open vSwitch support for OpenFlow 1.1 and beyond is a work in
progress.  This file describes the work still to be done.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>OpenFlow version support is not a build-time option.  A single build
of Open vSwitch must be able to handle all supported versions of
OpenFlow.  Ideally, even at runtime it should be able to support all
protocol versions at the same time on different OpenFlow bridges (and
perhaps even on the same bridge).</p>

<p>At the same time, it would be a shame to litter the core of the OVS
code with lots of ugly code concerned with the details of various
OpenFlow protocol versions.</p>

<p>The primary approach to compatibility is to abstract most of the
details of the differences from the core code, by adding a protocol
layer that translates between OF1.x and a slightly higher-level
abstract representation.  The core of this approach is the many struct
ofputil_* structures in lib/ofp-util.h.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this approach, OVS cannot use OpenFlow protocol
definitions that closely resemble those in the OpenFlow specification,
because openflow.h in different versions of the OpenFlow specification
defines the same identifier with different values.  Instead,
openflow-common.h contains definitions that are common to all the
specifications and separate protocol version-specific headers contain
protocol-specific definitions renamed so as not to conflict,
e.g. OFPAT10<em>ENQUEUE and OFPAT11</em>ENQUEUE for the OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.1
values for OFPAT<em>ENQUEUE.  Generally, in cases of conflict, the
protocol layer will define a more abstract OFPUTIL</em>* or struct
ofputil_*.</p>

<p>Here are the current approaches in a few tricky areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Port numbering.  OpenFlow 1.0 has 16-bit port numbers and later
OpenFlow versions have 32-bit port numbers.  For now, OVS
support for later protocol versions requires all port numbers to
fall into the 16-bit range, translating the reserved OFPP_* port
numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Actions.  OpenFlow 1.0 and later versions have very different
ideas of actions.  OVS reconciles by translating all the
versions' actions (and instructions) to and from a common
internal representation.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>OpenFlow 1.1</h2>

<p>The list of remaining work items for OpenFlow 1.1 is below.  It is
probably incomplete.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Match and set double-tagged VLANs (QinQ).  This requires kernel
work for reasonable performance.
[optional for OF1.1+]</p></li>
<li><p>VLANs tagged with 88a8 Ethertype.  This requires kernel work for
reasonable performance.
[required for OF1.1+]</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>OpenFlow 1.2</h2>

<p>OpenFlow 1.2 support requires OpenFlow 1.1 as a prerequisite. All the
additional work specific to Openflow 1.2 are complete.  (This is based
on the change log at the end of the OF1.2 spec.  I didn't compare the
specs carefully yet.)</p>

<h2>OpenFlow 1.3</h2>

<p>OpenFlow 1.3 support requires OpenFlow 1.2 as a prerequisite, plus the
following additional work.  (This is based on the change log at the
end of the OF1.3 spec, reusing most of the section titles directly.  I
didn't compare the specs carefully yet.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add support for multipart requests.
Currently we always report OFPBRC<em>MULTIPART</em>BUFFER_OVERFLOW.
[optional for OF1.3+]</p></li>
<li><p>IPv6 extension header handling support.  Fully implementing this
requires kernel support.  This likely will take some careful and
probably time-consuming design work.  The actual coding, once
that is all done, is probably 2 or 3 days work.
[optional for OF1.3+]</p></li>
<li><p>Per-flow meters.  OpenFlow protocol support is now implemented.
Support for the special OFPM<em>SLOWPATH and OFPM</em>CONTROLLER meters
is missing.  Support for the software switch is under review.
[optional for OF1.3+]</p></li>
<li><p>Auxiliary connections.  An implementation in generic code might
be a week's worth of work.  The value of an implementation in
generic code is questionable, though, since much of the benefit
of axuiliary connections is supposed to be to take advantage of
hardware support.  (We could make the kernel module somehow
send packets across the auxiliary connections directly, for
some kind of "hardware" support, if we judged it useful enough.)
[optional for OF1.3+]</p></li>
<li><p>Provider Backbone Bridge tagging.  I don't plan to implement
this (but we'd accept an implementation).
[optional for OF1.3+]</p></li>
<li><p>On-demand flow counters.  I think this might be a real
optimization in some cases for the software switch.
[optional for OF1.3+]</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>OpenFlow 1.4 &amp; ONF Extensions for 1.3.X Pack1</h2>

<p>The following features are both defined as a set of ONF Extensions
for 1.3 and integrated in 1.4.
When defined as an ONF Extension for 1.3, the feature is using the
Experimenter mechanism with the ONF Experimenter ID.
When defined integrated in 1.4, the feature use the standard OpenFlow
structures (for example defined in openflow-1.4.h).
The two definitions for each feature are independant and can exist in
parallel in OVS.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flow entry notifications
This seems to be modelled after OVS's NXST<em>FLOW</em>MONITOR.
(Simon Horman is working on this.)

<li><p>Role Status
Already implemented as a 1.4 feature.
