NAME
       ovs-testcontroller - simple OpenFlow controller for testing

SYNOPSIS
       ovs-testcontroller [options] method [method]...

DESCRIPTION
       ovs-testcontroller  is  a  simple  OpenFlow controller that manages any
       number of switches over the OpenFlow protocol, causing them to function
       as  L2 MAC-learning switches or hubs.  It is suitable for initial test‐
       ing of OpenFlow networks.  It is not a necessary or desirable part of a
       production OpenFlow deployment.

       ovs-testcontroller controls one or more OpenFlow switches, specified as
       one or more of the following OpenFlow connection methods:

              pssl:[port][:ip]
              ptcp:[port][:ip]
                     Listens for OpenFlow connections on  port.   The  default
                     port  is  6633, but a future version of Open vSwitch will
                     change the default to the  IANA-defined  port  6653.   By
                     default,  connections  are allowed from any IPv4 address.
                     Specify ip as an IPv4 address or a bracketed IPv6 address
                     (e.g.  ptcp:6633:[::1]).  DNS names may not be used.  For
                     pssl,  the  --private-key,--certificate,  and   --ca-cert
                     options are mandatory.

              punix:file
                     Listens  for  OpenFlow  connections  on  the  Unix domain
                     server socket named file.

              ssl:ip[:port]
              tcp:ip[:port]
                     The specified port on the host at  the  given  ip,  which
                     must  be  expressed  as an IP address (not a DNS name) in
                     IPv4 or IPv6 address  format.   Wrap  IPv6  addresses  in
                     square  brackets,  e.g.  tcp:[::1]:6633.   For  ssl,  the
                     --private-key, --certificate, and --ca-cert  options  are
                     mandatory.

                     If  port is not specified, it currently defaults to 6633.
                     In the future, the default will change to 6653, which  is
                     the IANA-defined value.

              unix:file
                     On POSIX, a Unix domain server socket named file.

                     On Windows, a localhost TCP port written in file.

OPTIONS
       -n
       --noflow
              By  default,  ovs-testcontroller sets up a flow in each OpenFlow
              switch whenever it receives a packet whose destination is  known
              due  through  MAC learning.  This option disables flow setup, so
              that every packet in the network passes through the controller.

              This option is most useful for debugging.  It reduces  switching
              performance, so it should not be used in production.

       --max-idle=secs|permanent
              Sets  secs  as  the  number of seconds that a flow set up by the
              controller will remain in the switch's flow  table  without  any
              matching  packets  being seen.  If permanent is specified, which
              is not recommended, flows will never expire.  The default is  60
              seconds.

              This  option  has  no  effect  when  -n  (or --noflow) is in use
              (because the controller does not set up flows in that case).

       -H
       --hub  By default, the controller acts as an  L2  MAC-learning  switch.
              This  option  changes  its behavior to that of a hub that floods
              packets on all but the incoming port.

              If -H (or --hub) and -n (or --noflow) are  used  together,  then
              the  cumulative  effect  is that every packet passes through the
              controller and every packet is flooded.

              This option is most useful for debugging.  It reduces  switching
              performance, so it should not be used in production.

       -w[wildcard_mask]
       --wildcards[=wildcard_mask]
              By  default, ovs-testcontroller sets up exact-match flows.  This
              option allows it to set up wildcarded flows,  which  may  reduce
              flow  setup latency by causing less traffic to be sent up to the
              controller.

              The optional wildcard_mask is an OpenFlow  wildcard  bitmask  in
              hexadecimal  that specifies the fields to wildcard.  If no wild‐
              card_mask is specified, the default value 0x2820F0 is used which
              specifies  L2-only  switching  and  wildcards  L3 and L4 fields.
              Another interesting value is 0x2000EC, which  specifies  L3-only
              switching and wildcards L2 and L4 fields.

              This  option  has  no  effect  when  -n  (or --noflow) is in use
              (because the controller does not set up flows in that case).

       -N
       --normal
              By default, ovs-testcontroller directs packets to  a  particular
              port  or  floods  them.   This  option  causes it to direct non-
              flooded packets to the OpenFlow OFPP_NORMAL port.   This  allows
              the  switch  itself to make decisions about packet destinations.
              Support for OFPP_NORMAL is optional in OpenFlow, so this  option
              may not well with some non-Open vSwitch switches.

       --mute Prevents  ovs-testcontroller  from replying to any OpenFlow mes‐
              sages sent to it by switches.

              This option is only for debugging the Open  vSwitch  implementa‐
              tion of ``fail open'' mode.  It must not be used in production.

       -q id
       --queue=id
              By  default,  ovs-testcontroller uses the default OpenFlow queue
              for sending packets and setting up  flows.   Use  one  of  these
              options,  supplying id as an OpenFlow queue ID as a decimal num‐
              ber, to instead use that specific queue.

              This option is incompatible with -N or --normal and with  -H  or
              --hub.   If  more  than  one is specified then this option takes
              precedence.

              This option may be useful for testing or  debugging  quality  of
              service setups.

       -Q port-name:queue-id

       --port-queue port-name:queue-id
              Configures  packets  received  on the port named port-name (e.g.
              eth0) to be output on OpenFlow queue ID queue-id (specified as a
              decimal  number).  For the specified port, this option overrides
              the default specified on -q or --queue.

              This option may be specified any number of times with  different
              port-name arguments.

              This  option  is incompatible with -N or --normal and with -H or
              --hub.  If more than one is specified  then  this  option  takes
              precedence.

              This  option  may  be useful for testing or debugging quality of
              service setups.

       --with-flows file
              When a switch connects, push the flow entries  as  described  in
              file.  Each line in file is a flow entry in the format described
              for the add-flows command in the  Flow  Syntax  section  of  the
              ovs-ofctl(8) man page.

              Use this option more than once to add flows from multiple files.

   Public Key Infrastructure Options
       -p privkey.pem
       --private-key=privkey.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              ovs-testcontroller's identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       -c cert.pem
       --certificate=cert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on -p or --private-key to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       -C cacert.pem
       --ca-cert=cacert.pem
              Specifies   a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate  that
              ovs-testcontroller should use to verify  certificates  presented
              to  it by SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL
              peers use to verify the certificate specified on  -c  or  --cer‐
              tificate,  or  it  may  be a different one, depending on the PKI
              design in use.)

       -C none
       --ca-cert=none
              Disables verification of certificates presented  by  SSL  peers.
              This  introduces a security risk, because it means that certifi‐
              cates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.

       --peer-ca-cert=peer-cacert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file that contains one or more  additional  cer‐
              tificates  to  send to SSL peers.  peer-cacert.pem should be the
              CA certificate used to sign  ovs-testcontroller's  own  certifi‐
              cate, that is, the certificate specified on -c or --certificate.
              If ovs-testcontroller's certificate is self-signed, then  --cer‐
              tificate and --peer-ca-cert should specify the same file.

              This  option  is not useful in normal operation, because the SSL
              peer must already have the CA certificate for the peer  to  have
              any  confidence in ovs-testcontroller's identity.  However, this
              offers a way for a new installation to bootstrap the CA certifi‐
              cate  on  its  first  SSL connection.  The following options are
              valid on POSIX based platforms.

       --pidfile[=pidfile]
              Causes a file (by default, ovs-testcontroller.pid) to be created
              indicating the PID of the running process.  If the pidfile argu‐
              ment is not specified, or if it does not begin with /,  then  it
              is created in /var/run/openvswitch.

              If --pidfile is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       --overwrite-pidfile
              By  default,  when --pidfile is specified and the specified pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              ovs-testcontroller  refuses  to start.  Specify --overwrite-pid‐
              file to cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When --pidfile is not specified, this option has no effect.

       --detach
              Causes ovs-testcontroller to detach itself from  the  foreground
              session and run as a background process.

       --monitor
              Creates  an additional process to monitor the ovs-testcontroller
              daemon.  If the daemon dies due to a  signal  that  indicates  a
              programming  error  (SIGABRT,  SIGALRM,  SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL,
              SIGPIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ) then the monitor  process
              starts  a  new  copy  of  it.   If  the daemon dies or exits for
              another reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with --detach, but  it  also  func‐
              tions without it.

       --no-chdir
              By  default,  when  --detach  is  specified,  ovs-testcontroller
              changes its current working  directory  to  the  root  directory
              after  it detaches.  Otherwise, invoking ovs-testcontroller from
              a carelessly chosen directory would  prevent  the  administrator
              from unmounting the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying   --no-chdir  suppresses  this  behavior,  preventing
              ovs-testcontroller from changing its current working  directory.
              This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common
              behavior to write core dumps into the current working  directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when --detach is not specified.

       -v[spec]
       --verbose=[spec]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any spec, sets the log level for
              every module and facility to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list  of
              words  separated  by  spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              ·      A valid module name, as displayed by the  vlog/list  com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              ·      syslog, console, or file, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.

                     On Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the --syslog-target option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              ·      off, emer, err, warn, info, or dbg, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   off  filters  out all messages.  See ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless of the log levels set for file,  logging  to  a  file
              will  not  take  place  unless --log-file is also specified (see
              below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       -v
       --verbose
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to --ver‐
              bose=dbg.

       -vPATTERN:facility:pattern
       --verbose=PATTERN:facility:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  facility  to  pattern.   Refer  to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       --log-file[=file]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If file is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name  used  if file is omitted is /var/log/openvswitch/ovs-test‐
              controller.log.

       --syslog-target=host:port
              Send syslog messages to UDP port on host,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The host must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

       --unixctl=socket
              Sets the name of the control socket on which  ovs-testcontroller
              listens  for runtime management commands (see RUNTIME MANAGEMENT
              COMMANDS, below).  If socket does not begin with /, it is inter‐
              preted as relative to /var/run/openvswitch.  If --unixctl is not
              used   at   all,   the   default   socket   is    /var/run/open‐
              vswitch/ovs-testcontroller.pid.ctl,  where  pid  is ovs-testcon‐
              troller's process ID.

              On Windows, uses a kernel chosen TCP port on  the  localhost  to
              listen  for  runtime management commands.  The kernel chosen TCP
              port value is written in a file whose absolute path  is  pointed
              by  socket. If --unixctl is not used at all, the file is created
              as ovs-testcontroller.ctl in the  configured  OVS_RUNDIR  direc‐
              tory.

              Specifying none for socket disables the control socket feature.

       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

       -O [version[,version]...]
       --protocols=[version[,version]...]
              Sets the OpenFlow protocol versions that are allowed when estab‐
              lishing an OpenFlow session.

              The following versions are considered to be  ready  for  general
              use.  These protocol versions are enabled by default:

              ·      OpenFlow10, for OpenFlow 1.0.

              Support  for  the  following  protocol  versions is provided for
              testing and development  purposes.   They  are  not  enabled  by
              default:

              ·      OpenFlow11, for OpenFlow 1.1.

              ·      OpenFlow12, for OpenFlow 1.2.

              ·      OpenFlow13, for OpenFlow 1.3.

EXAMPLES
       To  bind  locally to port 6633 (the default) and wait for incoming con‐
       nections from OpenFlow switches:

              % ovs-testcontroller ptcp:

       In the future, the default port number will change to  6653,  which  is
       the IANA-defined value.

BUGS
       Configuring  a  Citrix  XenServer to connect to a particular controller
       only points the remote OVSDB management connection to that  controller.
       It does not also configure OpenFlow connections, because the manager is
       expected to do that over the management  protocol.   ovs-testcontroller
       is not an Open vSwitch manager and does not know how to do that.

       As a stopgap workaround, ovs-vsctl can wait for an OVSDB connection and
       set the controller, e.g.:

              % ovs-vsctl -t0 --db=pssl: --certificate=cert.pem --ca-cert=none
              --private-key=privkey.pem   --peer-ca-cert=cacert.pem   set-con‐
              troller ssl:ip
