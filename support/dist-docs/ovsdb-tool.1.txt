DESCRIPTION
       The ovsdb-tool program is a command-line tool for managing Open vSwitch
       database (OVSDB) files.  It does not  interact  directly  with  running
       Open vSwitch database servers (instead, use ovsdb-client).

   Basic Commands
       create db schema
              Reads  an  OVSDB schema from the file named schema and creates a
              new OVSDB database file named db using  that  schema.   The  new
              database is initially empty.  This command will not overwrite an
              existing db.

              schema must contain an OVSDB schema in JSON  format.   Refer  to
              the OVSDB specification for details.

       compact db [target]
              Reads  db  and  writes a compacted version.  If target is speci‐
              fied, the compacted version is written as a new file named  tar‐
              get,  which  must not already exist.  If target is omitted, then
              the compacted version of the database replaces db in-place.

       convert db schema [target]
              Reads db, translating it into to the schema specified in schema,
              and  writes out the new interpretation.  If target is specified,
              the translated version is written as a new  file  named  target,
              which  must  not  already exist.  If target is omitted, then the
              translated version of the database replaces db in-place.

              This command can do simple ``upgrades'' and ``downgrades'' on  a
              database's  schema.   The  data  in db must be valid when inter‐
              preted under schema, with only one exception:  data  in  db  for
              tables  and  columns  that  do  not exist in schema are ignored.
              Columns that exist in schema but not in  db  are  set  to  their
              default values.  All of schema's constraints apply in full.

       needs-conversion db schema
              Reads  the  schema  embedded  in db and the standalone schema in
              schema and compares them.  If the schemas are the  same,  prints
              no on stdout; if they differ, print yes.

       db-version db
       schema-version schema
              Prints  the  version  number  in  the schema embedded within the
              database db or in the standalone schema  schema  on  stdout.   A
              schema    version    number    has    the   form   x.y.z.    See
              ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for details.

              Schema version numbers and  Open  vSwitch  version  numbers  are
              independent.

              If  schema or db was created before schema versioning was intro‐
              duced, then it will not have a version number and  this  command
              will print a blank line.

       db-cksum db
       schema-cksum schema
              Prints  the  checksum in the schema embedded within the database
              db or of the standalone schema schema on stdout.

              If schema or db was created before schema checksums were  intro‐
              duced,  then  it  will not have a checksum and this command will
              print a blank line.

       query db transaction
              Opens db, executes transaction on it, and  prints  the  results.
              The transaction must be a JSON array in the format of the params
              array for the JSON-RPC transact  method,  as  described  in  the
              OVSDB specification.

              The  db  is  opened  for  read-only  access, so this command may
              safely run concurrently with other database activity,  including
              ovsdb-server  and  other  database writers.  The transaction may
              specify database modifications, but these will have no effect on
              db.

       transact db transaction
              Opens  db,  executes  transaction on it, prints the results, and
              commits any changes to db.  The transaction must be a JSON array
              in  the  format  of  the  params array for the JSON-RPC transact
              method, as described in the OVSDB specification.

              The db is opened and locked for read/write access, so this  com‐
              mand  will  fail  if  the  database is opened for writing by any
              other process, including ovsdb-server(1).  Use  ovsdb-client(1),
              instead,   to   write   to   a   database   that  is  served  by
              ovsdb-server(1).

       show-log db
              Prints a summary of the records in db's log, including the  time
              and  date at which each database change occurred and any associ‐
              ated comment.  This may be useful for debugging.

              To increase the verbosity of output, add -m (or --more)  one  or
              more  times to the command line.  With one -m, show-log prints a
              summary of the records  added,  deleted,  or  modified  by  each
              transaction.   With  two -ms, show-log also prints the values of
              the columns modified by each change to a record.

OPTIONS
   Logging Options
       -v[spec]
       --verbose=[spec]
              Sets logging levels.  Without any spec, sets the log  level  for
              every  module and facility to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list of
              words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up  to  one  from
              each category below:

              ·      A  valid  module name, as displayed by the vlog/list com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              ·      syslog,  console,  or file, to limit the log level change
                     to only to the system log, to the console, or to a  file,
                     respectively.

                     On  Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and is
                     only useful along with the  --syslog-target  option  (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              ·      off,  emer,  err,  warn, info, or dbg, to control the log
                     level.  Messages of the given severity or higher will  be
                     logged,  and  messages of lower severity will be filtered
                     out.  off filters out all  messages.   See  ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless  of  the  log  levels set for file, logging to a file
              will not take place unless --log-file  is  also  specified  (see
              below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       -v
       --verbose
              Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent  to  --ver‐
              bose=dbg.

       -vPATTERN:facility:pattern
       --verbose=PATTERN:facility:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  facility  to  pattern.   Refer  to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       --log-file[=file]
              Enables logging to a file.  If file is  specified,  then  it  is
              used  as  the exact name for the log file.  The default log file
              name   used   if   file    is    omitted    is    /var/log/open‐
              vswitch/ovsdb-tool.log.

       --syslog-target=host:port
              Send  syslog  messages  to  UDP port on host, in addition to the
              system syslog.  The host must be a numerical IP address,  not  a
              hostname.

   Other Options
       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

FILES
       The  default db is /usr/etc/openvswitch/conf.db.  The default schema is
       /usr/share/openvswitch/vswitch.ovsschema.  The help command  also  dis‐
       plays these defaults.
