<h1>How to Install Open vSwitch on Red Hat Enterprise Linux</h1>

<p>This document describes how to build and install Open vSwitch on a Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) host.  If you want to install Open vSwitch
on a generic Linux host, see [INSTALL.md] instead.</p>

<p>We have tested these instructions with RHEL 5.6 and RHEL 6.0.</p>

<h2>Building Open vSwitch for RHEL</h2>

<p>You may build from an Open vSwitch distribution tarball or from an
Open vSwitch Git tree.</p>

<p>The default RPM build directory (_topdir) has five directories in
the top-level:
1. BUILD/ Where the software is unpacked and built.
2. RPMS/ Where the newly created binary package files are written.
3. SOURCES/ Contains the original sources, patches, and icon files.
4. SPECS/ Contains the spec files for each package to be built.
5. SRPMS/ Where the newly created source package files are written.</p>

<p>Before you begin, note the RPM sources directory on your version of
RHEL.  The command "rpmbuild --showrc" will show the configuration
for each of those directories. Alternatively, the command "rpm --eval
 '%{<em>topdir}'" shows the current configuration for the top level
directory and the command "rpm --eval '%{</em>sourcedir}'" does the same
for the sources directory. On RHEL 5, the default RPM _topdir is
/usr/src/redhat and the default RPM sources directory is
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES. On RHEL 6, the default _topdir is
$HOME/rpmbuild and the default RPM sources directory is
$HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install build prerequisites:</p>

<p><code>
yum install gcc make python-devel openssl-devel kernel-devel graphviz \
   kernel-debug-devel autoconf automake rpm-build redhat-rpm-config \
   libtool
</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you are building from a distribution tarball, skip to step 3.
Otherwise, you must be building from an Open vSwitch Git tree.
Determine what version of Autoconf is installed (e.g. run "autoconf
--version").  If it is not at least version 2.63, then you have two
choices:</p>

<p>a. Install Autoconf 2.63 or later, one way or another.</p>

<p>b. Create a distribution tarball on some other machine, by
    running "./boot.sh; ./configure; make dist" in the Git tree.
    You must run this on a machine that has the tools listed in
    [INSTALL.md] as prerequisites for building from a Git tree.
    Afterward, proceed with the rest of the instructions using
    the distribution tarball.</p></li>
<li><p>Some versions of the RHEL 6 kernel-devel package contain a broken
"build" symlink.  If you are using such a version, you must fix
the problem before continuing.</p>

<p>To find out whether you are affected, run:</p>

<p><code>
   cd /lib/modules/&lt;version&gt;
   ls -l build/
</code></p>

<p>where <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is the version number of the RHEL 6 kernel.  (The
trailing slash in the final command is important.  Be sure to include
it.)  If the "ls" command produces a directory listing, your
kernel-devel package is OK.  If it produces a "No such file or
directory" error, your kernel-devel package is buggy.</p>

<p>If your kernel-devel package is buggy, then you can fix it with:</p>

<p><code>
   cd /lib/modules/&lt;version&gt;
   rm build
   ln -s /usr/src/kernels/&lt;target&gt; build
</code></p>

<p>where <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> is the name of an existing directory under
/usr/src/kernels, whose name should be similar to <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> but may
contain some extra parts.  Once you have done this, verify the fix with
the same procedure you used above to check for the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are building from a distribution tarball, skip to step 5.
Otherwise, create a distribution tarball from the root of the Git
tree by running:</p>

<p><code>
   ./boot.sh
   ./configure
   make dist
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Now you have a distribution tarball, named something like
openvswitch-x.y.z.tar.gz.  Copy this file into the RPM sources
directory, e.g.:</p>

<p><code>cp openvswitch-x.y.z.tar.gz $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES</code></p></li>
<li><p>Make another copy of the distribution tarball in a temporary
directory.  Then unpack the tarball and "cd" into its root, e.g.:</p>

<p><code>
   tar xzf openvswitch-x.y.z.tar.gz
   cd openvswitch-x.y.z
</code></p></li>
<li><p>To build Open vSwitch userspace, run:</p>

<p><code>rpmbuild -bb rhel/openvswitch.spec</code></p>

<p>This produces two RPMs: "openvswitch" and "openvswitch-debuginfo".</p>

<p>The above command automatically runs the Open vSwitch unit tests.
To disable the unit tests, run:</p>

<p><code>rpmbuild -bb --without check rhel/openvswitch.spec</code></p>

<p>If the build fails with "configure: error: source dir
/lib/modules/2.6.32-279.el6.x86_64/build doesn't exist" or similar,
then the kernel-devel package is missing or buggy.  Go back to step
1 or 2 and fix the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>On RHEL 6, to build the Open vSwitch kernel module, copy
rhel/openvswitch-kmod.files into the RPM sources directory and run:</p>

<p><code>rpmbuild -bb rhel/openvswitch-kmod-rhel6.spec</code></p>

<p>You might have to specify a kernel version and/or variants, e.g.:</p>

<p><code>
rpmbuild -bb \
    -D "kversion 2.6.32-131.6.1.el6.x86_64" \
    -D "kflavors default debug kdump" \
    rhel/openvswitch-kmod-rhel6.spec
</code></p>

<p>This produces an "kmod-openvswitch" RPM for each kernel variant, in
this example: "kmod-openvswitch", "kmod-openvswitch-debug", and
"kmod-openvswitch-kdump".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A RHEL host has default firewall rules that prevent any Open vSwitch tunnel
traffic from passing through. If a user configures Open vSwitch tunnels like
Geneve, GRE, VXLAN, LISP etc., they will either have to manually add iptables
firewall rules to allow the tunnel traffic or add it through a startup script
(Please refer to the "enable-protocol" command in the ovs-ctl(8) manpage).</p>

<h2>Red Hat Network Scripts Integration</h2>

<p>Simple integration with Red Hat network scripts has been implemented.
Please read [rhel/README.RHEL] in the source tree or
/usr/share/doc/openvswitch/README.RHEL in the installed openvswitch
package for details.</p>
