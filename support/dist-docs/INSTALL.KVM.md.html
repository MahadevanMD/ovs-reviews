<h1>How to Use Open vSwitch with KVM</h1>

<p>This document describes how to use Open vSwitch with the Kernel-based
Virtual Machine (KVM). This document assumes that you have read and
followed [INSTALL.md] to get Open vSwitch setup on your Linux system.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>First, follow the setup instructions in [INSTALL.md] to get a working
Open vSwitch installation.</p>

<p>KVM uses tunctl to handle various bridging modes, which you can 
install with the Debian/Ubuntu package uml-utilities.</p>

<pre><code>  % apt-get install uml-utilities
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you will need to modify or create custom versions of the qemu-ifup
and qemu-ifdown scripts. In this guide, we'll create custom versions
that make use of example Open vSwitch bridges that we'll describe in this
guide.</p>

<p>Create the following two files and store them in known locations.</p>

<p>For example /etc/ovs-ifup and /etc/ovs-ifdown</p>

<p>/etc/ovs-ifup</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<p>switch='br0'
/sbin/ifconfig $1 0.0.0.0 up
ovs-vsctl add-port ${switch} $1
```</p>

<p>/etc/ovs-ifdown</p>

<p>```</p>

<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>

<p>switch='br0'
/sbin/ifconfig $1 0.0.0.0 down
ovs-vsctl del-port ${switch} $1
```</p>

<p>At the end of [INSTALL.md], it describes basic usage of creating
bridges and ports. If you haven't already, create a bridge named
br0 with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>  % ovs-vsctl add-br br0
</code></pre>

<p>Then, add a port to the bridge for the NIC that you want your guests
to communicate over (e.g. eth0):</p>

<pre><code>  % ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth0
</code></pre>

<p>Please refer to ovs-vsctl(8) for more details.</p>

<p>Next, we'll start a guest that will use our ifup and ifdown scripts.</p>

<pre><code>  % kvm -m 512 -net nic,macaddr=00:11:22:EE:EE:EE -net \
    tap,script=/etc/ovs-ifup,downscript=/etc/ovs-ifdown -drive \
    file=/path/to/disk-image,boot=on
</code></pre>

<p>This will start the guest and associate a tap device with it. The 
ovs-ifup script will add a port on the br0 bridge so that the
guest will be able to communicate over that bridge.</p>

<p>To get some more information and for debugging you can use Open
vSwitch utilities such as ovs-dpctl and ovs-ofctl, For example:</p>

<pre><code>  % ovs-dpctl show
  % ovs-ofctl show br0
</code></pre>

<p>You should see tap devices for each KVM guest added as ports to 
the bridge (e.g. tap0)</p>

<p>Please refer to ovs-dpctl(8) and ovs-ofctl(8) for more details.</p>
