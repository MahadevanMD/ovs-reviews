DESCRIPTION
       The ovsdb-server program provides RPC interfaces to one  or  more  Open
       vSwitch  databases  (OVSDBs).   It supports JSON-RPC client connections
       over active or passive TCP/IP or Unix domain sockets.

       Each OVSDB file may be specified on the command line as  database.   If
       none  is  specified,  the default is /usr/etc/openvswitch/conf.db.  The
       database files must already have been created  and  initialized  using,
       for example, ovsdb-tool create.

OPTIONS
       --remote=remote
              Adds remote as a connection method used by ovsdb-server.  remote
              must take one of the following forms:

              pssl:port[:ip]
                     Listen on the  given  SSL  port  for  a  connection.   By
                     default,  connections are not bound to a particular local
                     IP address and it listens only on  IPv4  (but  not  IPv6)
                     addresses,  but specifying ip limits connections to those
                     from the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.  If ip is
                     an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.:
                     pssl:6632:[::1].  The --private-key,  --certificate,  and
                     --ca-cert options are mandatory when this form is used.

              ptcp:port[:ip]
                     Listen  on  the  given  TCP  port  for  a connection.  By
                     default, connections are not bound to a particular  local
                     IP  address  and  it  listens only on IPv4 (but not IPv6)
                     addresses, but ip may be specified  to  listen  only  for
                     connections to the given ip, either IPv4 or IPv6 address.
                     If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip with square brack‐
                     ets, e.g.: ptcp:6632:[::1].

              punix:file
                     On  POSIX,  listen on the Unix domain server socket named
                     file for a connection.

                     On Windows, listen on a kernel chosen  TCP  port  on  the
                     localhost. The kernel chosen TCP port value is written in
                     file.

              ssl:ip:port
                     The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must  be  expressed  as an IP address (not a DNS name) in
                     IPv4 or IPv6 address format.  If ip is an  IPv6  address,
                     then  wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.: ssl:[::1]:6632.
                     The --private-key, --certificate, and  --ca-cert  options
                     are mandatory when this form is used.

              tcp:ip:port
                     Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4
                     or IPv6 address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then  wrap  ip
                     with square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6632.

              unix:file
                     On  POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
                     file.

                     On Windows, connect to a localhost TCP port  whose  value
                     is written in file.

              db:db,table,column
                     Reads additional connection methods from column in all of
                     the rows in table within db.  As the contents  of  column
                     changes,  ovsdb-server  also  adds  and  drops connection
                     methods accordingly.

                     If column's type is string or set of  strings,  then  the
                     connection  methods  are  taken directly from the column.
                     The connection methods in the column must have one of the
                     forms described above.

                     If column's type is UUID or set of UUIDs and references a
                     table, then each UUID is looked up in the referenced  ta‐
                     ble  to  obtain a row.  The following columns in the row,
                     if present and of the correct type, configure  a  connec‐
                     tion method.  Any additional columns are ignored.

                     target (string)
                            Connection  method,  in one of the forms described
                            above.  This column is mandatory: if it is missing
                            or  empty then no connection method can be config‐
                            ured.

                     max_backoff (integer)
                            Maximum number of  milliseconds  to  wait  between
                            connection attempts.

                     inactivity_probe (integer)
                            Maximum  number  of  milliseconds  of idle time on
                            connection to client before sending an  inactivity
                            probe message.

                     It is an error for column to have another type.

              To  connect or listen on multiple connection methods, use multi‐
              ple --remote options.

       --run=command]
              Ordinarily ovsdb-server runs forever, or until  it  is  told  to
              exit (see RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS below).  With this option,
              ovsdb-server instead starts a shell subprocess running  command.
              When  the  subprocess terminates, ovsdb-server also exits grace‐
              fully.  If the subprocess exits normally with exit code 0,  then
              ovsdb-server  exits  with  exit code 0 also; otherwise, it exits
              with exit code 1.

              This option can be useful where a database server is needed only
              to     run     a     single    command,    e.g.:    ovsdb-server
              --remote=punix:socket   --run='ovsdb-client   dump   unix:socket
              Open_vSwitch'

              This option is not supported on Windows platform.

   Daemon Options
       The following options are valid on POSIX based platforms.

       --pidfile[=pidfile]
              Causes a file (by default, ovsdb-server.pid) to be created indi‐
              cating the PID of the running process.  If the pidfile  argument
              is  not  specified,  or  if it does not begin with /, then it is
              created in /var/run/openvswitch.

              If --pidfile is not specified, no pidfile is created.

       --overwrite-pidfile
              By default, when --pidfile is specified and the  specified  pid‐
              file  already  exists  and  is  locked  by  a  running  process,
              ovsdb-server refuses to start.  Specify  --overwrite-pidfile  to
              cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile.

              When --pidfile is not specified, this option has no effect.

       --detach
              Causes ovsdb-server to detach itself from the foreground session
              and run as a  background  process.  ovsdb-server  detaches  only
              after it starts listening on all configured remotes.

       --monitor
              Creates  an  additional process to monitor the ovsdb-server dae‐
              mon.  If the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates  a  pro‐
              gramming  error  (SIGABRT, SIGALRM, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIG‐
              PIPE, SIGSEGV, SIGXCPU, or SIGXFSZ)  then  the  monitor  process
              starts  a  new  copy  of  it.   If  the daemon dies or exits for
              another reason, the monitor process exits.

              This option is normally used with --detach, but  it  also  func‐
              tions without it.

       --no-chdir
              By default, when --detach is specified, ovsdb-server changes its
              current  working  directory  to  the  root  directory  after  it
              detaches.   Otherwise,  invoking  ovsdb-server from a carelessly
              chosen directory would prevent the administrator from unmounting
              the file system that holds that directory.

              Specifying   --no-chdir  suppresses  this  behavior,  preventing
              ovsdb-server from changing its current working directory.   This
              may  be  useful  for  collecting  core files, since it is common
              behavior to write core dumps into the current working  directory
              and the root directory is not a good directory to use.

              This option has no effect when --detach is not specified.

   Service Options
       The following options are valid only on Windows platform.

       --service
              Causes  ovsdb-server  to run as a service in the background. The
              service should already have been created through external  tools
              like SC.exe.

       --service-monitor
              Causes the ovsdb-server service to be automatically restarted by
              the Windows services manager if the service dies  or  exits  for
              unexpected reasons.

              When --service is not specified, this option has no effect.

   Logging Options
       -v[spec]
       --verbose=[spec]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any spec, sets the log level for
              every module and facility to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list  of
              words  separated  by  spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              ·      A valid module name, as displayed by the  vlog/list  com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              ·      syslog, console, or file, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.

                     On Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the --syslog-target option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              ·      off, emer, err, warn, info, or dbg, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   off  filters  out all messages.  See ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless of the log levels set for file,  logging  to  a  file
              will  not  take  place  unless --log-file is also specified (see
              below).

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       -v
       --verbose
              Sets  the  maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to --ver‐
              bose=dbg.

       -vPATTERN:facility:pattern
       --verbose=PATTERN:facility:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  facility  to  pattern.   Refer  to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       --log-file[=file]
              Enables  logging  to  a  file.  If file is specified, then it is
              used as the exact name for the log file.  The default  log  file
              name    used    if    file    is   omitted   is   /var/log/open‐
              vswitch/ovsdb-server.log.

       --syslog-target=host:port
              Send syslog messages to UDP port on host,  in  addition  to  the
              system  syslog.   The host must be a numerical IP address, not a
              hostname.

   Public Key Infrastructure Options
       The options described below for configuring the SSL public  key  infra‐
       structure  accept  a  special  syntax for obtaining their configuration
       from the database.  If any of these options is given db:db,table,column
       as  its  argument, then the actual file name is read from the specified
       column in table within the db database.   The  column  must  have  type
       string  or  set  of strings.  The first nonempty string in the table is
       taken as the file name.  (This means that ordinarily there should be at
       most one row in table.)

       -p privkey.pem
       --private-key=privkey.pem
              Specifies  a  PEM  file  containing  the  private  key  used  as
              ovsdb-server's identity for outgoing SSL connections.

       -c cert.pem
       --certificate=cert.pem
              Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
              private  key specified on -p or --private-key to be trustworthy.
              The certificate must be signed by the certificate authority (CA)
              that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.

       -C cacert.pem
       --ca-cert=cacert.pem
              Specifies   a  PEM  file  containing  the  CA  certificate  that
              ovsdb-server should use to verify certificates presented  to  it
              by  SSL peers.  (This may be the same certificate that SSL peers
              use to verify the certificate specified on -c or  --certificate,
              or  it  may  be  a different one, depending on the PKI design in
              use.)

       -C none
       --ca-cert=none
              Disables verification of certificates presented  by  SSL  peers.
              This  introduces a security risk, because it means that certifi‐
              cates cannot be verified to be those of known trusted hosts.

       --bootstrap-ca-cert=cacert.pem
              When cacert.pem exists, this option has the same effect as -C or
              --ca-cert.  If it does not exist, then ovsdb-server will attempt
              to obtain the CA certificate from the SSL peer on its first  SSL
              connection and save it to the named PEM file.  If it is success‐
              ful, it will immediately drop the connection and reconnect,  and
              from then on all SSL connections must be authenticated by a cer‐
              tificate signed by the CA certificate thus obtained.

              This option exposes the SSL connection  to  a  man-in-the-middle
              attack  obtaining the initial CA certificate, but it may be use‐
              ful for bootstrapping.

              This option is only useful if the SSL peer sends its CA certifi‐
              cate  as  part  of  the SSL certificate chain.  The SSL protocol
              does not require the server to send the CA certificate.

              This option is mutually exclusive with -C and --ca-cert.

   Other Options
       --unixctl=socket
              Sets the name of the control socket on which  ovsdb-server  lis‐
              tens  for  runtime  management  commands (see RUNTIME MANAGEMENT
              COMMANDS, below).  If socket does not begin with /, it is inter‐
              preted as relative to /var/run/openvswitch.  If --unixctl is not
              used   at   all,   the   default   socket   is    /var/run/open‐
              vswitch/ovsdb-server.pid.ctl,   where   pid   is  ovsdb-server's
              process ID.

              On Windows, uses a kernel chosen TCP port on  the  localhost  to
              listen  for  runtime management commands.  The kernel chosen TCP
              port value is written in a file whose absolute path  is  pointed
              by  socket. If --unixctl is not used at all, the file is created
              as ovsdb-server.ctl in the configured OVS_RUNDIR directory.

              Specifying none for socket disables the control socket feature.

       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS
       ovs-appctl(8) can send commands to a running ovsdb-server process.  The
       currently supported commands are described below.

   OVSDB-SERVER COMMANDS
       These commands are specific to ovsdb-server.

       exit   Causes ovsdb-server to gracefully terminate.

       ovsdb-server/compact [db]...
              Compacts each database db in-place.  If no db is specified, com‐
              pacts every database in-place.  Databases are also automatically
              compacted occasionally.

       ovsdb-server/reconnect
              Makes ovsdb-server drop all of the JSON-RPC connections to data‐
              base clients and reconnect.

              This command might be useful for debugging issues with  database
              clients.

       ovsdb-server/add-remote remote
              Adds  a  remote, as if --remote=remote had been specified on the
              ovsdb-server command line.  (If remote is already a remote, this
              command succeeds without changing the configuration.)

       ovsdb-server/remove-remote remote
              Removes  the  specified  remote  from the configuration, failing
              with an error if remote is not configured  as  a  remote.   This
              command  only  works with remotes that were named on --remote or
              ovsdb-server/add-remote, that is, it  will  not  remove  remotes
              added  indirectly  because  they  were read from the database by
              configuring a db:db,table,column  remote.   (You  can  remove  a
              database source with ovsdb-server/remove-remote db:db,table,col‐
              umn, but not individual remotes  found  indirectly  through  the
              database.)

       ovsdb-server/list-remotes
              Outputs  a  list  of  the  currently configured remotes named on
              --remote or ovsdb-server/add-remote, that is, it does  not  list
              remotes  added  indirectly because they were read from the data‐
              base by configuring a db:db,table,column remote.

       ovsdb-server/add-db database
              Adds the database to the  running  ovsdb-server.   The  database
              file  must  already have been created and initialized using, for
              example, ovsdb-tool create.

       ovsdb-server/remove-db database
              Removes database from the running ovsdb-server.   database  must
              be a database name as listed by ovsdb-server/list-dbs.

              If  a  remote  has  been configured that points to the specified
              database (e.g. --remote=db:database,... on  the  command  line),
              then  it  will  be disabled until another database with the same
              name is added again (with ovsdb-server/add-db).

              Any public key infrastructure  options  specified  through  this
              database  (e.g.  --private-key=db:database,...  on  the  command
              line) will be disabled until another database with the same name
              is added again (with ovsdb-server/add-db).

       ovsdb-server/list-dbs
              Outputs  a  list  of  the  currently  configured databases added
              either   through   the   command    line    or    through    the
              ovsdb-server/add-db command.

   VLOG COMMANDS
       These commands manage ovsdb-server's logging settings.

       vlog/set [spec]
              Sets  logging  levels.  Without any spec, sets the log level for
              every module and facility to dbg.  Otherwise, spec is a list  of
              words  separated  by  spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
              each category below:

              ·      A valid module name, as displayed by the  vlog/list  com‐
                     mand on ovs-appctl(8), limits the log level change to the
                     specified module.

              ·      syslog, console, or file, to limit the log  level  change
                     to  only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
                     respectively.

                     On Windows platform, syslog is accepted as a word and  is
                     only  useful  along  with the --syslog-target option (the
                     word has no effect otherwise).

              ·      off, emer, err, warn, info, or dbg, to  control  the  log
                     level.   Messages of the given severity or higher will be
                     logged, and messages of lower severity will  be  filtered
                     out.   off  filters  out all messages.  See ovs-appctl(8)
                     for a definition of each log level.

              Case is not significant within spec.

              Regardless of the log levels set for file,  logging  to  a  file
              will  not  take  place  unless ovsdb-server was invoked with the
              --log-file option.

              For compatibility with older versions of OVS, any is accepted as
              a word but has no effect.

       vlog/set PATTERN:facility:pattern
              Sets  the  log  pattern  for  facility  to  pattern.   Refer  to
              ovs-appctl(8) for a description of the valid syntax for pattern.

       vlog/list
              Lists the supported logging modules and their current levels.

       vlog/reopen
              Causes ovsdb-server to close and reopen its log file.  (This  is
              useful  after  rotating log files, to cause a new log file to be
              used.)

              This has no effect unless  ovsdb-server  was  invoked  with  the
              --log-file option.

       vlog/disable-rate-limit [module]...
       vlog/enable-rate-limit [module]...
              By  default,  ovsdb-server limits the rate at which certain mes‐
              sages can be logged.  When a  message  would  appear  more  fre‐
              quently  than  the  limit,  it  is  suppressed.  This saves disk
              space, makes logs easier to read, and speeds up  execution,  but
              occasionally  troubleshooting  requires more detail.  Therefore,
              vlog/disable-rate-limit allows rate limits to be disabled at the
              level  of  an individual log module.  Specify one or more module
              names, as displayed by the vlog/list command.  Specifying either
              no  module  names at all or the keyword any disables rate limits
              for every log module.

              The vlog/enable-rate-limit command, whose syntax is the same  as
              vlog/disable-rate-limit,  can  be used to re-enable a rate limit
              that was previously disabled.

   MEMORY COMMANDS
       These commands report memory usage.

       memory/show
              Displays  some  basic  statistics  about  ovsdb-server's  memory
              usage.   ovsdb-server  also  logs  this  information  soon after
              startup and periodically as its memory consumption grows.

   COVERAGE COMMANDS
       These commands manage ovsdb-server's ``coverage counters,'' which count
       the  number of times particular events occur during a daemon's runtime.
       In addition to these commands, ovsdb-server automatically logs coverage
       counter  values,  at INFO level, when it detects that the daemon's main
       loop takes unusually long to run.

       Coverage counters are useful mainly for performance analysis and debug‐
       ging.

       coverage/show
              Displays the averaged per-second rates for the last few seconds,
              the last minute and the last hour, and the total counts  of  all
              of the coverage counters.

SPECIFICATIONS
       ovsdb-server  implements  the  Open  vSwitch  Database (OVSDB) protocol
       specified in RFC 7047, with the following clarifications:

       3.1. JSON Usage
              RFC 4627 says that names within a JSON object should be  unique.
              The Open vSwitch JSON parser discards all but the last value for
              a name that is specified more than once.

              The definition of <error> allows for implementation  extensions.
              Currently  ovsdb-server  uses  the  following additional "error"
              strings which might change in later releases):

              syntax error or unknown column
                     The request could not be parsed as an OVSDB request.   An
                     additional  "syntax" member, whose value is a string that
                     contains JSON, may narrow down the particular syntax that
                     could not be parsed.

              internal error
                     The request triggered a bug in ovsdb-server.

              ovsdb error
                     A map or set contains a duplicate key.

       3.2. Schema Format
              RFC  7047  requires  the  "version"  field in <database-schema>.
              Current versions of ovsdb-server allow it to be omitted  (future
              versions are likely to require it).

       4. Wire Protocol
              The original OVSDB specifications included the following reason,
              omitted from RFC 7047,  to  operate  JSON-RPC  directly  over  a
              stream instead of over HTTP:

              ·      JSON-RPC  is  a  peer-to-peer  protocol,  but  HTTP  is a
                     client-server protocol, which is  a  poor  match.   Thus,
                     JSON-RPC  over  HTTP  requires the client to periodically
                     poll the server to receive server requests.

              ·      HTTP is more  complicated  than  stream  connections  and
                     doesn't provide any corresponding advantage.

              ·      The  JSON-RPC  specification for HTTP transport is incom‐
                     plete.

       4.1.5. Monitor
              For backward compatibility,  ovsdb-server  currently  permits  a
              single  <monitor-request>  to be used instead of an array; it is
              treated  as  a  single-element  array.    Future   versions   of
              ovsdb-server might remove this compatibility feature.

              Because  the  <json-value> parameter is used to match subsequent
              update notifications (see below) to  the  request,  it  must  be
              unique  among all active monitors.  ovsdb-server rejects attempt
              to create two monitors with the same identifier.

       5.1. Notation
              For <condition>, RFC  7047  only  allows  the  use  of  !=,  ==,
              includes,  and  excludes operators with set types.  Open vSwitch
              2.4 and later extend <condition> to allow the use of <, <=,  >=,
              and > operators with columns with type ``set of 0 or 1 integer''
              and ``set of 0 or 1 real''.  These conditions evaluate to  false
              when the column is empty, and otherwise as described in RFC 7047
              for integer and real types.

       6. IANA Considerations
              ovsdb-server currently defaults to its  historical  port  number
              6632.   Future  versions  will  adopt IANA-assigned port 6640 as
              default.
