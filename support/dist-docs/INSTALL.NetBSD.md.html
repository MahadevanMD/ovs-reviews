<h1>How to Install Open vSwitch on NetBSD</h1>

<p>On NetBSD, you might want to install requirements from pkgsrc.
In that case, you need at least the following packages.</p>

<ul>
<li>automake</li>
<li>libtool-base</li>
<li>gmake</li>
<li>python27</li>
<li>py27-xml</li>
<li>pkg_alternatives</li>
</ul>

<p>Some components have additional requirements. (See [INSTALL.md])</p>

<p>Assuming you are running NetBSD/amd64 6.1.2, you can download and
install pre-built binary packages as the following.
(You might get some warnings about minor version mismatch.  Don't care.)</p>

<pre><code>```
# PKG_PATH=http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/amd64/6.1.2/All/
# export PKG_PATH
# pkg_add automake libtool-base gmake python27 py27-xml pkg_alternatives
```
</code></pre>

<p>NetBSD's <code>/usr/bin/make</code> is not GNU make.  GNU make is installed as
<code>/usr/pkg/bin/gmake</code> by the above mentioned <code>gmake</code> package.</p>

<p>As all executables installed with pkgsrc are placed in <code>/usr/pkg/bin/</code>
directory, it might be a good idea to add it to your PATH.</p>

<p>Open vSwitch on NetBSD is currently "userspace switch" implementation
in the sense described in [INSTALL.userspace.md] and [PORTING.md].</p>
