NAME
       ovs-l3ping - check network deployment for L3 tunneling problems

SYNOPSIS
       ovs-l3ping -s TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask] -t tunnelmode
       ovs-l3ping -s TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask][:ControlPort] -t tunnelmode

       ovs-l3ping -c TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask],RemoteInnerIP -t tunnelmode
       ovs-l3ping     -c     TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask][:ControlPort[:Data‐
       Port]],RemoteInnerIP[:ControlPort[:DataPort]] [-b targetbandwidth]  [-i
       testinterval] -t tunnelmode

       Common options:
              [-h | --help] [-V | --version]


DESCRIPTION
       The  ovs-l3ping program may be used to check for problems that could be
       caused by invalid routing policy, misconfigured firewall in the  tunnel
       path  or  a  bad  NIC  driver.   On one of the nodes, run ovs-l3ping in
       server mode and on the other node run it in client  mode.   The  client
       and  server  will establish L3 tunnel, over which client will give fur‐
       ther testing instructions. The ovs-l3ping client will perform  UDP  and
       TCP  tests.   This tool is different from ovs-test that it encapsulates
       XML/RPC control connection over the tunnel, so there is no need to open
       special holes in firewall.

       UDP  tests  can  report  packet loss and achieved bandwidth for various
       datagram sizes. By default target bandwidth for UDP tests is 1Mbit/s.

       TCP tests report only achieved  bandwidth,  because  kernel  TCP  stack
       takes care of flow control and packet loss.

   Client Mode
       An ovs-l3ping client will create a L3 tunnel and connect over it to the
       ovs-l3ping server to schedule the tests. TunnelRemoteIP is  the  peer's
       IP  address,  where  tunnel  will be terminated. InnerIP is the address
       that will be temporarily assigned during  testing.   All  test  traffic
       originating from this IP address to the RemoteInnerIP will be tunneled.
       It is possible to override default ControlPort and DataPort,  if  there
       is any other application that already listens on those two ports.

   Server Mode
       To  conduct  tests,  ovs-l3ping server must be running.  It is required
       that both client and server InnerIP addresses are in the  same  subnet.
       It is possible to specify InnerIP with netmask in CIDR format.

OPTIONS
       One of -s or -c is required.  The -t option is also required.

       -s TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask][:ControlPort]
       --server TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask][:ControlPort]
              Run  in  server  mode  and create L3 tunnel with the client that
              will be accepting tunnel at TunnelRemoteIP address.  The  socket
              on   InnerIP[:ControlPort]  will  be  used  to  receive  further
              instructions from the client.

       -c     TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask][:ControlPort[:DataPort]],RemoteIn‐
       nerIP[:ControlPort[:DataPort]]
       --client              TunnelRemoteIP,InnerIP[/mask][:ControlPort[:Data‐
       Port]],RemoteInnerIP[:ControlPort[:DataPort]]
              Run in client mode and create L3 tunnel with the server on  Tun‐
              nelRemoteIP.  The client will use InnerIP to generate test traf‐
              fic with the server's RemoteInnerIP.

       -b targetbandwidth
       --bandwidth targetbandwidth
              Target bandwidth for UDP  tests.  The  targetbandwidth  must  be
              given  in  bits per second. It is possible to use postfix M or K
              to alter the target bandwidth magnitude.

       -i testinterval
       --interval testinterval
              How long each test should run. By default 5 seconds.

       -t tunnelmode
       --tunnel-mode tunnelmode
              Specify the tunnel type. This option must match  on  server  and
              client.

       -h
       --help Prints a brief help message to the console.

       -V
       --version
              Prints version information to the console.

EXAMPLES
       On  host 192.168.122.220 start ovs-l3ping in server mode.  This command
       will create a temporary GRE tunnel with the  host  192.168.122.236  and
       assign  10.1.1.1/28  as the inner IP address, where client will have to
       connect:

              ovs-l3ping -s 192.168.122.236,10.1.1.1/28 -t gre

       On host 192.168.122.236 start ovs-l3ping in client mode.  This  command
       will  use  10.1.1.2/28  as  the local inner IP address and will connect
       over the L3 tunnel to the server's inner IP address at 10.1.1.1.

              ovs-l3ping -c 192.168.122.220,10.1.1.2/28,10.1.1.1 -t gre
